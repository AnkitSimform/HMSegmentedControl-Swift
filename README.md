# HMSegmentedControl-Swift

This repo is an attempt to create a version of the original [**HMSegmentedControl**](https://github.com/HeshamMegid/HMSegmentedControl) that uses modern Cocoa APIs and Swift 3.0.

HMSegmentedControl-Swift currently only has a small subset of the features of **HMSegmentedControl**, and it's not ready for production use yet. Feel free to create issues and submit pull requests to help port over all the features.
